# odin-recipes
This project is just to test my knowledge of everything that I have learned
so far in the past couple lessons. I will be attempting to create a simple
webpage that will link to different recipes on the website. I'm assuming
that I will be demonstrating the ability to write paragraphs, headers, use
different formats, create links, and submit images.
